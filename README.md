# CPP
## Basic C++ Syntax and Semantics
### Main()
> It is the main application routine. C++ is made up of classes and objects, but contains atleast one C-like function, called the main(). It's special feature is that, it has an implicit return 0 statement, since most operating systems interpret it as "program completed successfully".
